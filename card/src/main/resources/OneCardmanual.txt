How to Play One Card

1. The dealer deals out seven cards for two players (in this game, the dealer and the user).
2. When both players have been dealt their hands, one card is laid face-up in the middle of the console to form the discard pile.
3. The rest of the deck laid face-down (in the console environment, concealed) beside the top card forming the stock pile. 
4. The player takes turn first, discarding one of his/her cards if the pattern or number matches with the top card.
5. Then the dealer takes turn.
6. The playing continues until one of players' cards runs out.
