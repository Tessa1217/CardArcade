How to play blackjack

Equally well known as Twenty-One.
The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without a bust (going over 21). 
1. Before the deal begins, each player (dealer, player) places a bet.
2. The dealer throughly shuffles portions of the pack and gives two cards face up to the player.
3. The dealer takes two cards, the second card face down.
4. When first two cards are not "blackjack", the player can decide between hit and stand options.
5. If the player decides to "hit", the dealer gives another card.
6. If the player decides to "stand", the dealer opens the face-down card.

BlackJack 
1. If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack".
The player gets twice the bet. 
2. If the dealer has a natural, the player loses twice the bet.
3. If both players (dealer, player) have natural, the bet of the player is a stand-off and the player takes back his or her original bet.
